                    <h3>Why create this?</h3>
                    <p>Living in big cities is great because of serendipitous moments where you bump into someone and have an interesting conversation that may change the course of your life. The online world is missing this. I built 6monthcatchup to give those serendipitous catch-ups with friends or past colleagues no matter where you're at in the world.</p>
